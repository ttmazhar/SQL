# The following SQL code was written by me to solve the problems on https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql

#1. Query the list of CITY names from STATION which have vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, and u) as both their first and last characters. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
 SELECT DISTINCT CITY
 FROM STATION
 WHERE LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') 
 AND SUBSTR(CITY, LENGTH(CITY), 1) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');
 
 
#2. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
 SELECT DISTINCT CITY
 FROM STATION
 WHERE NOT LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1)) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');
 
 
#3. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
 SELECT DISTINCT CITY
 FROM STATION
 WHERE NOT SUBSTR(CITY, LENGTH(CITY), 1) IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');
 
 
#4. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that either do not start with vowels or do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
 SELECT DISTINCT CITY
 FROM STATION
 WHERE LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1)) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') 
 OR SUBSTR(CITY, LENGTH(CITY), 1) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');
 
 
 #5. Query the list of CITY names from STATION that do not start with vowels and do not end with vowels. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
  SELECT DISTINCT CITY
  FROM STATION
  WHERE LOWER(SUBSTR(CITY, 1, 1)) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') 
  AND SUBSTR(CITY, LENGTH(CITY), 1) NOT IN ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');

#6. Query the Name of any student in STUDENTS who scored higher than  Marks. Order your output by the last three characters of each name.
If two or more students both have names ending in the same last three characters (i.e.: Bobby, Robby, etc.), secondary sort them by ascending ID.
 SELECT Name FROM Students
 WHERE Marks > 75
 ORDER BY RIGHT(Name, 3), Id;
