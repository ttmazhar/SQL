# The following SQL code was written by me to solve the problems on https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql

#1. Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) from the Employee table in alphabetical order.
 SELECT name FROM Employee
 ORDER BY name ASC;
 
 
#2. Write a query that prints a list of employee names (i.e.: the name attribute) for employees in Employee having a salary greater than $2000 per month
who have been employees for less than 10 months. Sort your result by ascending employee_id.
 SELECT name FROM Employee
 WHERE salary > '2000' AND months < '10'
 ORDER BY employee_id ASC;
 
 
#3. Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than 38.7880 and less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.
 SELECT ROUND(SUM(LAT_N),4) FROM STATION
 WHERE LAT_N BETWEEN 38.7880 AND 137.2345;
 
 
#4. Query the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION that is less than 137.2345 . Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.
 SELECT ROUND(MAX(LAT_N),4) FROM STATION
 WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345;
 
 
#5. Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than 137.2345 . Round your answer to 4 decimal places.
 SELECT ROUND((LONG_W),4)FROM STATION
 WHERE LAT_N = (SELECT MAX(LAT_N) FROM STATION 
 WHERE  LAT_N < 137.2345)
 ;
