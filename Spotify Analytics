# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.

# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.

# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL.

# Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL
)

# Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

# Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

# First I selected the whole table. Just to have an overall view of the table that I am working with.
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;


# How many times does Dua Lipa appear on the list?
SELECT COUNT(artist_name)
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  WHERE artist_name='Dua Lipa';


# How many times does Bad Bunny appear on the list?
SELECT COUNT(artist_name)
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  WHERE artist_name='Bad Bunny';


# How many Tracks are by Justin Bieber listed on the table and their names?
SELECT 
artist_name
,COUNT(track_name)
,track_name
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  WHERE artist_name='Justin Bieber';
  

# What are the 5 most popular tracks?
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,MAX(popularity)
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  GROUP BY track_name
  ORDER BY popularity DESC
  LIMIT 5;


# First I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track.
SELECT
artist_name,
track_name,
avg(popularity),
avg(danceability),
avg(energy)
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;


# Which of the tracks have duration starting with 21?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  WHERE duration_ms LIKE '21____%';


# Who is the artist that shows up the most on the list?
SELECT artist_name
,COUNT(artist_name) as artist_value
  FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
  GROUP BY artist_name
  ORDER BY artist_value DESC LIMIT 1;


# Which song is the longest?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(duration_ms)
 FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;
